# PURCHASE ANALYSIS OF MY AMAZON ORDERS

A Python - Tableau integration project

In this project I am going to analyze my purchase data from amazon.in since 2015.
The main aim of this project is to understand how much I have spend on amazon.in (online shopping), what are the major cateories in which I have spend, spend analysis over time, etc.
I have used python programming to clean the data and Tableau for visualization.<br>
